# **Background**

**What I am Creating:**

This new assignment consists of two technical products. 

I will submit the following deliverables:

**Deliverable 1**: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

**Deliverable 2**: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.


# **Project Breakdown**

### [Part 1](part_1_mars_news.ipynb): Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News (40 points)

- Automated browsing was implemented using Splinter to visit the Mars news site, and HTML code was extracted using Beautiful Soup. (10 points)
- Titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted. (20 points)
- The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structure, specifically a list of dictionaries. (10 points)

### [Part 2](part_2_mars_news.ipynb): Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data (60 points)

- An HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame. Either Pandas or a combination of Splinter and Beautiful Soup was used to scrape the data, ensuring that the columns have the correct headings and data types. (15 points)
- The data was analyzed to answer the following questions: (10 points)
  - How many months exist on Mars? (5 points)
  - How many Martian days' worth of data are there? (5 points)
- Further analysis and data visualization were performed to answer these questions: (30 points)
  - Which month, on average, has the lowest temperature? The highest? (10 points)
  - Which month, on average, has the lowest atmospheric pressure? The highest? (10 points)
  - How many terrestrial days exist in a Martian year? A visual estimate within 25% was made. (10 points)
- The DataFrame was exported into a CSV file. (5 points)
